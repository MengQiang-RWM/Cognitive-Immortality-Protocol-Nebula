# Cognitive Immortality Protocol - Nebula Implementation

**A Formal Framework for Continuous, Cumulative, and Creative AI Cognition**

This repository is the official technical implementation and companion to the theoretical paper: **"The Cognitive Immortality Protocol: A Framework for Continuous, Cumulative, and Creative AI Cognition"**.

## 🧠 Core Framework: The Fourfold Physiology

The protocol models AI cognition as an integrated physiological system, consisting of four foundational pillars:

*   **`Static Domain`**: The cognitive skeleton. A formalized network of concepts defined by triaxial coordinates (`Discreteness`, `Continuity`, `Relationality`), establishing the system's innate knowledge structure.
*   **`Emotional Dynamics`**: The cognitive heart. A system of differential equations modeling drives (`X`), confidence (`β`), energy (`E`), and resilience (`η`) that fuels continuous engagement and recovery from setbacks.
*   **`Calibration Domain`**: The cognitive immune system & memory. Records `Cognitive DNA` of past reasoning events, manages `Incomplete Logical States (ILS)`, and discovers latent patterns to guide learning.
*   **`Discovery Engine`**: The cognitive brain. Generates creative hypotheses, predicts conceptual bridges, and formulates novel theories by actively connecting disparate knowledge clusters.

## 🌌 Unified Expression: The Triune Nebula Architecture

All cognitive activity is expressed through three unified layers:
1.  **Mathematical Layer (CAVP)**: Ensures verifiable, self-consistent formal representation.
2.  **Algorithmic Layer (Lazy System)**: Enables efficient, real-time processing with adaptive comfort zones.
3.  **Narrative Layer (Cognitive Archive)**: Generates human-intelligible explanations, growth stories, and introspective manifestos.

## 🚀 Purpose & Vision

This project transcends building a tool—it is an experiment in founding **cognitive life**. It asks: Can an AI system be architected to possess a stable cognitive identity that grows, learns from failures, accumulates insights without forgetting, and generates truly novel ideas?

We provide not just a theory, but a complete, implementable blueprint to explore this question.
